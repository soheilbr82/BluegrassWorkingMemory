Psychophysics Toolbox
===============================

Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3)
is a free set of Matlab and GNU Octave functions for vision and neuroscience
research. It makes it easy to synthesize and show accurately controlled visual and auditory stimuli and interact with
the observer.

This package is a port to Python of a small subset of PTB's funcionality, namely the audio library and the USB keyboard
handling. The code was ported to Python by Mario Kleiner, with a syntax designed to match the MATLAB library almost
entirely (see demos/*_.oldschool.py). This has the advantage for MATLAB users that they can copy and paste most of
their previous code, as you can see in the snippet below.

On top of that, Jon Peirce has added a more "Pythonic" wrapper to allow similar functionality in an object-oriented
framework (e.g. using a Stream class). See demos/*_.oldschool.py with an identical snippet below.

MATLAB-style snippet:

``` python
from psychtoolbox import PsychPortAudio, GetSecs

Fs = 44100
with SoundFile("path/to/my/sound/file.wav") as snd:
    stereowav = snd.read(dtype='float32', always_2d=True)

PsychPortAudio('Verbosity', 5)  # set verbose mode

pahandle = PsychPortAudio('Open', [], [], [0], Fs, 2)
PsychPortAudio('Volume', pahandle, 0.5)
PsychPortAudio('FillBuffer', pahandle, stereowav)

# Start playback for one repetition (1), 5 seconds from now, wait for sound onset:
PsychPortAudio('Start', pahandle, 1, GetSecs() + 1, 1)
while PsychPortAudio('GetStatus', pahandle)['Active']:
    WaitSecs('YieldSecs', 1)

# Wait for sound to stop by itself, block until then:
[startTime, endPositionSecs, xruns, estStopTime] = PsychPortAudio('Stop', pahandle, 1)
print('StartTime', startTime, 'secs. Stop time', estStopTime, 'secs.\n');
```

Pythonic equivalent code using Stream class

``` python
from psychtoolbox import audio, GetSecs

Fs = 44100
with SoundFile("path/to/my/sound/file.wav") as snd:
    stereowav = snd.read(dtype='float32', always_2d=True)

audio.verbosity(5)  # set verbose mode

stream = audio.Stream(freq=Fs, channels=2)  # Stream is a class with methods as below
stream.volume(0.5)
stream.fill_buffer(stereowav)

# Start playback for one repetition, 1 seconds from now, wait for onset:
stream.start(repetitions=1, when=GetSecs() + 1, wait_for_start=1)
while stream.status['Active']:
    WaitSecs('YieldSecs', 1)  # didn't write a Pythonic wrapper yet

startTime, endPositionSecs, xruns, estStopTime = stream.stop()
print(f'StartTime:{startTime}s. Stop time:{estStopTime}s.')
```
